# Archive

This folder contains the original, more granular Silk reverse-engineering notes (00–12 + an AGENTS knowledge map).

The active docs live one level up in `prototypes/salary-book-react/reference/silkhq/` and are consolidated into fewer files for easier maintenance.

If you need to compare or recover phrasing, use the archive; otherwise prefer the consolidated set.
