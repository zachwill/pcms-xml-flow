# Design Evolution Backlog (`web/`)

North star:
- Entity index pages are explorer workbenches (Salary Book-like interaction model, not clones).
- Fast scanning, meaningful knobs, dense interactive rows, and sidebar drill-ins.
- Canonical pattern: `#commandbar` + `#maincanvas` + `#rightpanel-base` + `#rightpanel-overlay`.
- Salary Book remains read-only and is the interaction quality bar.
- Team Summary, System Values, and Two-Way Utility evolve in parallel toward stronger workbench UX.

Rubric (1-5):
1) Scan speed
2) Information hierarchy
3) Interaction predictability
4) Density/readability balance
5) Navigation/pivots

Current focus reset (2026-02-12):
- Push index surfaces away from `<table>` rendering toward dense flex-row workbench grammar.
- Two-Way Utility row anatomy is the nearest non-Salary-Book reference for this migration.
- Salary Book Tankathon table-to-flex migration is now enabled as a strict exception (only the Tankathon frame partial; no other Salary Book files).

- [ ] [P1] [INDEX] /agents — replace table rendering with flex-row workspace and compress Sort controls
  - Problem: `/agents` still uses table markup for both agents/agencies lenses, and the commandbar Sort cluster is too wide/noisy to scan quickly.
  - Hypothesis: A dense flex-row list plus a compact Sort selector + stacked Direction control will improve scan speed and reduce commandbar crowding.
  - Scope (files):
    - web/app/views/entities/agents/index.html.erb
    - web/app/views/entities/agents/_workspace_main.html.erb
    - web/app/views/entities/shared/commandbar.html.erb
    - web/app/controllers/entities/agents_controller.rb
    - web/app/controllers/entities/agents_sse_controller.rb
    - web/test/integration/entities_agents_index_test.rb
  - Acceptance criteria:
    - Agents commandbar no longer shows an overlong Sort radio run; sort key is compact (select or split control), with Direction visually stacked below in the same knob column.
    - Agents lens rows render as div-based flex rows (no `<table>` in `_workspace_main`) while preserving row click → overlay behavior.
    - Agencies lens rows inside `/agents` use the same flex-row grammar and density as agents lens.
    - SSE refresh keeps commandbar/maincanvas/sidebar state synchronized with selected overlay preserved when still in scope.

    - Navigation/pivots: 4 → 5
  - Guardrails:
    - Do not modify Salary Book files.

- [ ] [P1] [INDEX] /players — shift from single table-rail scan to sectioned flex rows (Two-Way Utility style)
  - Problem: `/players` remains visually table-like (single rigid rail + dense numeric columns), which makes long scans feel spreadsheet-heavy instead of workbench-oriented.
  - Hypothesis: Sectioned flex rows (with lightweight section headers) will preserve density while improving orientation and reducing cognitive reset during long scans.
  - Scope (files):

    - web/app/controllers/entities/players_sse_controller.rb
    - web/test/integration/entities_players_index_test.rb
  - Acceptance criteria:
    - Player rows remain div-based and dense, but are organized into explicit flex sections (e.g., by active lens bucket) instead of one uninterrupted table-like lane.
    - Section headers remain sticky/legible during scroll and keep cap columns aligned with row cells.
    - Compare strip + Pin A/Pin B controls continue working with no regression in overlay/URL sync behavior.
    - Sidebar and overlay selection state is preserved through SSE refreshes when selected player remains in filtered scope.
  - Rubric (before → target):
    - Scan speed: 4 → 5
    - Information hierarchy: 4 → 5
    - Interaction predictability: 4 → 5
    - Density/readability: 4 → 4
    - Navigation/pivots: 4 → 5
  - Guardrails:
    - Do not modify Salary Book files.

- [ ] [P1] [INDEX] /teams — reframe cap-pressure rows into sectioned flex lanes instead of table-like striping
  - Problem: `/teams` rows are dense and useful, but still read like a flat table pass rather than pressure-oriented workbench sections.
  - Hypothesis: Pressure-bucket sectioning with flex-row lanes will improve first-pass triage while keeping compare behavior intact.
  - Scope (files):
    - web/app/views/entities/teams/_workspace_main.html.erb

    - web/app/controllers/entities/teams_controller.rb
    - web/app/controllers/entities/teams_sse_controller.rb
    - web/test/integration/entities_teams_index_test.rb
  - Acceptance criteria:
    - Teams workspace presents rows in pressure-oriented sections (not one continuous table-like lane) while keeping current cap metrics visible.
    - Section transitions are obvious during scroll and preserve numeric alignment/hover affordances.
    - Compare slots and pin actions still function across sections, with selected state preserved on refresh.
    - Commandbar pressure posture and sidebar snapshot remain synchronized via one SSE response.
  - Rubric (before → target):
    - Scan speed: 4 → 5
    - Information hierarchy: 4 → 5
    - Interaction predictability: 4 → 5

    - Navigation/pivots: 4 → 5
  - Guardrails:
    - Do not modify Salary Book files.

- [ ] [P1] [INDEX] /agencies — migrate agency explorer from table markup to flex-row workbench scan
  - Problem: `/agencies` is still table-rendered, which breaks visual consistency with newer workbench-style index surfaces and slows row-level triage.
  - Hypothesis: A flex-row workspace with the same identity/metric grammar as `/agents` and Two-Way Utility will improve scan continuity and make pivots more predictable.
  - Scope (files):
    - web/app/views/entities/agencies/_workspace_main.html.erb

    - web/app/controllers/entities/agencies_sse_controller.rb
    - web/test/integration/entities_agencies_index_test.rb
  - Acceptance criteria:
    - Agency list rows are rendered with div/flex row primitives (no `<table>` in `_workspace_main`).
    - Existing row click → sidebar overlay behavior is unchanged and selected-row highlighting remains obvious.
    - Numeric columns remain mono/tabular and preserve current density.
    - Current lens/sort/query params continue to round-trip correctly via URL + SSE refresh.

- [ ] [P1] [INDEX] /drafts — de-table grid/list views and make ownership risk severity visible before drill-in
  - Problem: `/drafts` still relies on table-heavy rendering across grid/picks/selections, and users must click repeatedly to discover high-risk ownership cells.
  - Hypothesis: Moving all three views to dense flex-based workbench rows/cells plus explicit risk severity encoding will improve triage speed before drill-in.
=======
- [x] [P1] [INDEX] /drafts — improve grid triage by making ownership risk severity visible before drill-in
  - Problem: Grid users had to open many cells to determine which ownership slots were normal, at-risk, or critical.
  - Hypothesis: Inline severity encoding + in-surface legend would make triage faster and make drill-ins intentional.
>>>>>>> 0379a9d (design: drafts grid ownership risk triage)

    - web/app/views/entities/drafts/_rightpanel_base.html.erb
    - web/test/integration/entities_pane_endpoints_test.rb
<<<<<<< HEAD
  - Acceptance criteria:
    - Grid, picks, and selections presentations in `/drafts` use flex/div row-cell grammar (no `<table>` rendering in `_results`).
    - Grid cells expose a consistent 3-tier risk treatment (normal / at-risk / critical) with legend copy in-surface.
    - Risk treatment uses the same underlying risk scoring as sidebar summary counts.
    - Overlay selection state remains preserved through sort/lens/view SSE refresh when selected item remains visible.
    - Team and year pivots remain one click from row/cell or overlay.
  - Rubric (before → target):
=======
  - What changed:
    - Added a shared grid risk-tier derivation in `DraftsController` (`normal` / `at_risk` / `critical`) and wired each cell to carry tier label + ownership risk score.
    - Added sidebar summary tier counts (`severity_counts`) computed from the same tier logic used by existing at-risk/critical sidebar KPIs.
    - Updated grid cells in `_results` to render visible tier chips, risk score (`R#`), and compact encumbrance tokens before drill-in.
    - Added an in-surface ownership risk legend above the grid and a matching “Grid risk tiers” explainer block in `#rightpanel-base`.
    - Kept existing overlay open/restore flow intact (grid refresh still preserves selected cell when visible).
    - Expanded integration coverage to assert SSE grid refresh payload includes tier legend/treatment and risk-score encoding.
  - Why this improves the flow:
    - Analysts can now identify critical ownership cells immediately without opening each overlay.
    - Legend + chips create a stable, shared severity grammar across main grid and sidebar snapshot.
    - Triage remains predictable during sort/lens refresh because one SSE response still patches results + sidebar + overlay state together.
  - Verification:
    - `cd web && bundle exec ruby -Itest test/integration/entities_pane_endpoints_test.rb -i "/drafts (pane|grid refresh surfaces|refresh|sidebar)/"`

- [ ] [P2] [TOOL] /tools/two-way-utility — add intent search to find one player fast without leaving team-section context
  - Problem: Users scanning many team sections cannot quickly jump to a known player name/id.
  - Hypothesis: Commandbar intent search with in-context filtering/highlighting will cut navigation time while preserving workbench density.

- [ ] [P2] [TOOL] /tools/salary-book (Tankathon view only) — replace table board with Salary Book-style flex rows
  - Problem: Tankathon view still renders as a traditional table, which feels inconsistent with the Salary Book flex-row scanning grammar and slows visual comparison.
  - Hypothesis: Rebuilding Tankathon rows/cells as dense flex divs (matching Salary Book row anatomy) will improve scan rhythm while preserving one-click team switching.
  - Scope (files):
    - web/app/views/tools/salary_book/_maincanvas_tankathon_frame.html.erb
  - Acceptance criteria:
    - Tankathon board renders with div/flex row primitives (no `<table>` in the Tankathon frame partial).
    - Team row identity + standings metrics remain aligned and scannable at current density.
    - Row click still dispatches `salarybook-switch-team` and switches the active team as before.
    - Active-team visual treatment remains obvious and consistent with current Salary Book hover/selection grammar.

- [ ] [P1] [INDEX] /transactions — support fast day-by-day feed triage with date-grouped scanning
  - Problem: Long transaction lists are flat, forcing users to repeatedly re-read dates while scanning.

    - web/test/integration/entities_pane_endpoints_test.rb
  - Acceptance criteria:
    - Transactions render in date-grouped blocks (today-first chronology) with clear separators using flex-row groups (no `<table>` in `_results`).
    - Grouping works with intent search and type filters without breaking row click → overlay flow.
    - Sidebar quick feed mirrors grouped chronology for top rows.
    - Overlay preservation behavior remains correct when filtered results still contain selected row.
  - Rubric (before → target):
    - Scan speed: 3 → 5

- [ ] [P1] [INDEX] /trades — make team-in/team-out impact obvious from the list before opening overlay
  - Problem: Trade rows show team count and assets, but not immediate net direction by team, causing extra overlay opens.

    - Trades list uses dense flex rows (no `<table>` in `_results`) while preserving current row density.
    - Each trade row includes a compact team-impact summary (at least outgoing/incoming emphasis for primary teams).
    - Composition and complexity lenses continue to behave consistently with summary labels.
    - Sidebar quick deals include the same impact grammar as main rows.
    - Overlay opens with unchanged route and selected-state behavior.

  - Acceptance criteria:
    - Commandbar exposes a metric finder that can target system/tax/minimum/rookie metrics.
    - Choosing a metric scrolls to the relevant section/row and opens corresponding sidebar drill-in.
    - Overlay query params remain canonical and survive SSE refresh.
    - Existing section visibility toggles and scrollspy continue to work.

- [ ] [P1] [INDEX] /agents — allow agency-anchored narrowing while keeping agency overlay context
  - Problem: After opening an agency overlay, users still scan the full agent list and must mentally filter represented agents.

    - When an agency overlay is active, users can toggle a scoped view showing only represented agents.
    - Scoped mode preserves agency overlay and keeps row highlight/tie-back cues.
    - Clearing scope returns to prior filters/sort without losing overlay state.

- [ ] [P1] [INDEX] /draft-selections — make provenance severity legible at row glance for faster shortlist building
  - Problem: Provenance intensity is mostly numeric and requires close reading across many rows.

- [ ] [P3] [INDEX] /agencies — add direct “open in agents lens” pivot from agency rows/overlay
  - Problem: Agency triage often requires immediate jump into agent-level rows, but pivot requires manual nav/filter recreation.
