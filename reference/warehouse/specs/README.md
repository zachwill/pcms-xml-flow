# Specs — `reference/warehouse/specs/`

This directory contains **evidence-based mental model specs** for Sean’s current Excel workbook exports in `reference/warehouse/*.json`.

- Start with: `00-index.md` (workbook overview + dependency graph)
- Then: one spec per worksheet export (usually named after the JSON file, e.g. `y.md`, `dynamic_contracts.md`, etc.)

> Note: `reference/sean/` is legacy (older workbook version). Prefer `reference/warehouse/` + specs here.
