# reference/pcms

Reference notes derived from (or cross-checked against) the **official NBA PCMS** tooling.

These are *not* the CBA/Ops manual write-ups; they’re the “how the internal tool actually behaves”
mental models we extracted from PCMS frontend bundles (rounding, date boundaries, edge-case rules).

Use alongside:
- Repo truth: `pcms.*` warehouses + `pcms.fn_*` primitives
- Evidence/specs: `reference/warehouse/*`
