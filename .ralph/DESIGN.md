# Design Evolution Backlog (`web/`)

North star:
- Entity **index pages** are explorer workbenches (fast scan, tight pivots, dense rows).
- Entity **detail pages** are decision dossiers (what changed, why it matters, what to do next).
- Canonical pattern remains `#commandbar` + `#maincanvas` + sidebar layers where applicable.
- Salary Book remains read-only reference quality, except approved Tankathon partial work.
- Tool surfaces continue evolving in parallel (System Values / Two-Way / Team Summary).

Rubric (1-5):
1) Scan speed
2) Information hierarchy
3) Interaction predictability
4) Density/readability balance
5) Navigation/pivots

## Audit snapshot (2026-02-13)

- Index convergence wave succeeded: `/agents`, `/players`, `/teams`, `/agencies`, `/drafts`, `/draft-selections`, `/transactions`, `/trades` now largely operate in flex-row workbench grammar.
- Tankathon exception succeeded in approved Salary Book frame file.
- Biggest remaining UX gap is now **entity detail pages** (`/players/:slug`, `/agents/:slug`, `/teams/:slug`, etc.), which still contain many table-heavy sections and weaker “next action” flow.

## Supervisor correction — track lock (2026-02-13)

- Last 4 commits were **high-value flow upgrades** (agents/teams/transactions/trades detail pages), not cosmetic churn.
- Guardrail check passed: no forbidden Salary Book paths were touched.
- Datastar boundary check passed: multi-region team refresh remains one SSE in `Entities::TeamsSseController#refresh`; team bootstrap remains `text/html` morph-by-id.

Drift detected:
- Work stayed in **ENTITY detail** track, while current loop direction is now stricter: prioritize **INDEX convergence** or **TOOL evolution**.

Corrective TODOs for next worker cycle (mandatory):
- Next commits must be tagged and scoped as exactly one track: `[INDEX]` or `[TOOL]`.
- One surface + one user flow per commit (no cross-surface bundles).
- Each task entry must include: patch targets (`#commandbar/#maincanvas/#rightpanel-base/#rightpanel-overlay` as applicable), response type (`text/html` vs `text/event-stream`), and before/after rubric scores.
- Prefer flow outcomes (knobs, scan speed, pivots, drill-ins) over class-only visual polish.

### Immediate supervisor-gated queue (pick from here next)

- [x] [P0] [INDEX] /transactions — explorer commandbar knobs + severity-first scan lanes
  - User flow: scan latest movement → narrow by impact/type → drill into one transaction in sidebar without leaving index context.
  - Scope (files):
    - `web/app/controllers/entities/transactions_controller.rb`
    - `web/app/controllers/entities/transactions_sse_controller.rb`
    - `web/app/views/entities/transactions/index.html.erb`
    - `web/app/views/entities/transactions/_results.html.erb`
    - `web/app/views/entities/transactions/_rightpanel_base.html.erb`
    - `web/test/integration/entities_transactions_index_test.rb`
  - Patch targets: `#commandbar`, `#maincanvas`, `#rightpanel-base`, `#rightpanel-overlay`
  - Response type: multi-region filter/lens refresh remains one `text/event-stream` response (`Entities::TransactionsSseController#refresh`).
  - What changed (files):
    - Added URL-stable `impact` knob wiring (`all/critical/high/medium/low`) in `index.html.erb` and server state parsing in `transactions_controller.rb`; propagated through SSE signal patching (`txnimpact`) in `transactions_sse_controller.rb`.
    - Enriched transaction index rows with ledger + artifact rollups (cap/tax/apron deltas, ledger row count, exception/dead-money/budget counts), computed severity tiers server-side, and applied severity-lens filtering before render.
    - Rebuilt `transactions/_results.html.erb` into severity-first scan lanes (critical → low), with nested date buckets, impact chips, and compact delta lines (`Max Δ`, `Cap`, `Tax`, `Apron`) while preserving one-click pivots to transaction/player/team and sidebar drill-ins.
    - Reworked `transactions/_rightpanel_base.html.erb` into severity-aware snapshot + quick feed lanes so the sidebar mirrors the same impact grammar as main scan.
    - Added focused integration coverage in `entities_transactions_index_test.rb` for commandbar impact knob presence, severity lane rendering, single-SSE multi-region refresh behavior, and overlay preserve/clear behavior under impact filtering.
  - Why this improves the flow:
    - First-pass triage now starts with impact severity instead of flat date-only scanning, so high-risk movement is visible immediately.
    - Narrowing by impact + type is now explicit and URL/share-state stable.
    - Row-level compact delta signatures reduce drill-ins needed to identify meaningful transactions.
    - Sidebar quick feed uses the same severity grammar, improving predictability between scan and drill-in.
  - Rubric (before → after):
    - Scan speed: 3 → 5
    - Information hierarchy: 3 → 5
    - Interaction predictability: 4 → 5
    - Density/readability: 4 → 4
    - Navigation/pivots: 4 → 5
  - Follow-up tasks discovered:
    - Add optional severity threshold customization (e.g., user-selectable dollar cutoffs) without breaking default canonical lane definitions.
    - Add lane-level quick toggles (`dead-money only`, `exception-usage only`) as secondary refinements on top of the primary impact lens.

- [x] [P0] [TOOL] /tools/two-way-utility — keyboard shortlist + one-keystroke overlay open
  - User flow: type intent → pick top match via keyboard → open player overlay while keeping team section context.
  - Scope (implemented files):
    - `web/app/controllers/tools/two_way_utility_controller.rb`
    - `web/app/views/tools/two_way_utility/show.html.erb`
    - `web/app/views/tools/two_way_utility/_commandbar.html.erb`
    - `web/app/views/tools/two_way_utility/_workspace_main.html.erb`
    - `web/test/integration/tools_two_way_utility_test.rb`
  - Patch targets: `#commandbar`, `#maincanvas`, `#rightpanel-overlay`
  - Response rule: commandbar+overlay or main+overlay updates use one `text/event-stream` refresh; single overlay open continues as `text/html` via `/tools/two-way-utility/sidebar/:id`.
  - What changed (files):
    - Added server-ranked intent shortlist derivation (`INTENT_SHORTLIST_LIMIT`, ranking score, risk-aware tie-breakers) and default shortlist cursor state in `two_way_utility_controller.rb`; wired cursor signals into SSE refresh payload (`twintentcursor`, `twintentcursorindex`).
    - Extended workspace signals in `show.html.erb` to include shortlist cursor defaults so initial render and subsequent SSE refreshes share the same keyboard state contract.
    - Rebuilt commandbar intent block in `_commandbar.html.erb` to support keyboard-first shortlist flow: debounced intent refresh, inline ranked shortlist chips, arrow-key cursor movement, and Enter-to-open overlay (`/sidebar/:id`) without leaving the team board context.
    - Updated top-of-board guidance copy in `_workspace_main.html.erb` to advertise shortlist keyboard grammar while intent is active.
    - Expanded `tools_two_way_utility_test.rb` assertions to cover shortlist rendering, keyboard wiring presence, and SSE signal propagation for shortlist cursor state.
  - Why this improves the flow:
    - Intent search now resolves to a ranked shortlist directly in the commandbar, so users can triage likely targets before scrolling through team sections.
    - Enter now opens the currently highlighted shortlist row in one keystroke, preserving maincanvas team grouping and compare-board pins.
    - Cursor state is server-synchronized across SSE refreshes, making keyboard behavior deterministic after every lens/intent update.
  - Rubric (before → after):
    - Scan speed: 4 → 5
    - Information hierarchy: 4 → 5
    - Interaction predictability: 4 → 5
    - Density/readability: 4 → 4
    - Navigation/pivots: 4 → 5
  - Follow-up tasks discovered:
    - Add optional explicit shortcut hints/focus trap (`Ctrl+K` style) so users can jump to intent input and shortlist without pointer movement.
    - Add server-returned match-reason labels (`prefix`, `id exact`, `substring`) to make shortlist ranking rationale visible for ambiguous queries.

- [x] [P1] [ENTITY] /players/:slug — replace table-heavy contract sections with dense flex dossier lanes
  - Problem: Contract history, guarantees, incentives, and ledger sections still read like disconnected spreadsheet tables.
  - Hypothesis: Converting to unified flex-row dossier lanes will reduce context switching and improve “what matters now” comprehension.
  - Scope (files):
    - web/app/views/entities/players/_section_contract_history.html.erb
    - web/app/views/entities/players/_section_guarantees.html.erb
    - web/app/views/entities/players/_section_incentives.html.erb
    - web/app/views/entities/players/_section_ledger.html.erb
    - web/test/integration/entities_players_show_test.rb
  - What changed (files):
    - Replaced all table markup in the four target player dossier sections with dense flex-row lane layouts using consistent identity + metric cells (`entity-cell-two-line`).
    - Added explicit high-signal chips/flags across lanes (PO/TO/ETO, FULL/PARTIAL/NON guarantees, No-Trade, Trade Bonus, conditional protections, likely/unlikely incentives).
    - Added focused integration coverage in `entities_players_show_test.rb` to assert lane rendering, absence of `<table>` in targeted sections, and visibility of key flags.
  - Why this improves the flow:
    - Contract reading now follows one scan grammar across chronology → guarantees → incentives → ledger, reducing mode-switching between differently shaped tables.
    - Year/event identity is anchored in left lanes while money/flags stay in predictable right metric cells, making “what matters now” faster to parse.
    - Pivots (team/transaction/trade links) remain inline in the same row context instead of buried in wide table columns.
  - Acceptance criteria:
    - No `<table>` markup remains in the four target player section partials.
    - Section rows use consistent identity + metric cell grammar (year/event/action + money/flags).
    - High-signal flags (option, no-trade, trade bonus, guarantee type) are visible at row glance.
  - Rubric (before → after):
    - Scan speed: 3 → 5
    - Information hierarchy: 3 → 5
    - Interaction predictability: 4 → 5
    - Density/readability: 3 → 4
    - Navigation/pivots: 4 → 5
  - Follow-up tasks discovered:
    - Add a compact “next decisions” rail near constraints/contract horizon so the same lane grammar surfaces upcoming option/expiry triggers first.
    - Consider harmonizing Vitals/Connections/Team History onto the same lane grammar to complete full-page dossier consistency.
  - Guardrails:
    - Do not modify Salary Book files.

- [x] [P1] [ENTITY] /players/:slug — add “next decisions” rail (options, expirings, guarantee triggers)
  - Problem: The page surfaces lots of history but does not foreground immediate decision points.
  - Hypothesis: A compact decision rail near header/constraints will improve planning speed and downstream pivots.
  - Scope (files):
    - web/app/views/entities/players/show.html.erb
    - web/app/views/entities/players/_section_constraints.html.erb
    - web/app/views/entities/players/_section_contract.html.erb
    - web/app/views/entities/players/_rightpanel_base.html.erb
    - web/test/integration/entities_players_show_test.rb
  - What changed (files):
    - Added a new top-level section rail at `web/app/views/entities/players/_section_next_decisions.html.erb`, wired into `show.html.erb` (full + deferred skeleton + local nav) and bootstrap rendering via `web/app/controllers/entities/players_sse_controller.rb`.
    - Added a shared decision-item builder in `web/app/helpers/entities_helper.rb` (`player_next_decision_items`) that composes option windows, expirings, partial/non-guarantee branches, and protection-condition triggers with urgency labels.
    - Updated `web/app/views/entities/players/_section_constraints.html.erb` and `_section_contract.html.erb` to expose rail handoff cues (“Jump to next decisions” + decision counts) so planning flow starts near posture and contract horizon.
    - Updated `web/app/views/entities/players/_rightpanel_base.html.erb` (player-show branch) to add a compact decision shortlist with direct team / transaction / trade pivots.
    - Expanded `web/test/integration/entities_players_show_test.rb` to assert the new `#next-decisions` section, no table markup, decision labels/urgency cues, and pivot-link presence.
  - Why this improves the flow:
    - Immediate decisions are now first-class and scanable by season + urgency instead of buried across contract, guarantees, and ledger sections.
    - Users can jump from constraints → decision rail → deep section anchors without losing context, reducing backtracking.
    - Every decision lane now carries direct pivots (team + transaction/trade where available), tightening analysis-to-action flow.
  - Acceptance criteria:
    - Decision rail lists upcoming option/expiry/trigger items with season labels and urgency cues.
    - Each decision item has direct pivot links (team, transaction/trade where available).
    - Local nav + decision rail maintain stable anchors for fast jump/read.
  - Rubric (before → after):
    - Scan speed: 3 → 5
    - Information hierarchy: 3 → 5
    - Interaction predictability: 4 → 5
    - Density/readability: 4 → 4
    - Navigation/pivots: 4 → 5
  - Follow-up tasks discovered:
    - Add rail-level filters (`Urgent`, `Upcoming`, `Later`) and persist lens state in URL hash/query.
    - Replace fallback ledger linking for some trigger rows with explicit source linkage when contract trigger → transaction mapping becomes available in warehouse.
  - Guardrails:
    - Do not modify Salary Book files.

- [x] [P1] [ENTITY] /agents/:slug — convert table/card mix into sectioned flex workbench with client cohorts
  - Problem: Agent page mixes cards and multiple tables, making large client books hard to triage quickly.
  - Hypothesis: Cohort-based flex lanes (max-level, expiring, restricted, two-way) will speed portfolio reading.
  - Scope (files):
    - web/app/views/entities/agents/show.html.erb
    - web/app/views/entities/agents/_sticky_header.html.erb
    - web/test/integration/entities_agents_show_test.rb
  - What changed (files):
    - Rebuilt `web/app/views/entities/agents/show.html.erb` into sectioned lane grammar: posture + book horizon + new `#client-cohorts` + lane-based team footprint + lane-based full client roster + lane-based historical trend (replacing prior table/card-heavy primary flow).
    - Added reusable dense row partial `web/app/views/entities/agents/_client_lane.html.erb` to keep cohort and full-roster rows consistent (identity + cap/decision metrics + status chips + direct player/team pivots).
    - Updated `web/app/views/entities/agents/_sticky_header.html.erb` to support compact `posture_chips` so risk/posture cues (max/expiring/restricted/options) stay visible while scanning.
    - Added focused integration coverage in `web/test/integration/entities_agents_show_test.rb` that stubs the workspace payload and asserts cohort sections, lane rendering, pivot-link presence, and absence of `<table>` markup in key client sections.
  - Why this improves the flow:
    - Portfolio triage now starts from explicit cohorts (max-level, expiring, restricted, two-way) instead of forcing users to scan a single mixed roster table.
    - Cohort headers surface count + cap rollups immediately, so users can prioritize where negotiation/risk work is concentrated.
    - A single dense lane grammar across cohorts + full roster + team footprint reduces mode switching and preserves one-click pivots to player/team pages.
  - Acceptance criteria:
    - Key client sections use flex-row lanes instead of table markup.
    - Cohort headers show counts + cap rollups and preserve direct player/team pivots.
    - Header/posture chips remain dense and immediately legible.
  - Rubric (before → after):
    - Scan speed: 3 → 5
    - Information hierarchy: 3 → 5
    - Interaction predictability: 4 → 5
    - Density/readability: 3 → 4
    - Navigation/pivots: 4 → 5
  - Follow-up tasks discovered:
    - Add cohort filters/toggles (`show overlap`, `hide empty cohorts`) with URL-persisted state for faster repeat workflows.
    - Add cohort-level pivot actions (open cohort in Salary Book for active team/year lens) to tighten workbench→tool handoff.
  - Guardrails:
    - Do not modify Salary Book files.

- [x] [P1] [ENTITY] /teams/:slug — de-table activity, two-way, and apron provenance into causal flow lanes
  - Problem: Team detail still has table-heavy operational sections that fragment the cap story.
  - Hypothesis: Converting these sections to dense flow lanes will improve “what changed and why” understanding.
  - Scope (files):
    - web/app/views/entities/teams/_section_activity.html.erb
    - web/app/views/entities/teams/_section_two_way.html.erb
    - web/app/views/entities/teams/_section_apron_provenance.html.erb
    - web/app/views/entities/teams/show.html.erb
    - web/app/controllers/entities/teams_sse_controller.rb
    - web/test/integration/entities_teams_show_test.rb
  - What changed (files):
    - Rebuilt `web/app/views/entities/teams/_section_activity.html.erb` into lane-based “event → consequence” rows for both ledger and exception usage, with direct player / transaction / trade pivots and inline cap/tax/apron deltas.
    - Rebuilt `web/app/views/entities/teams/_section_two_way.html.erb` into a capacity posture lane + watchlist usage lanes (games used, limit, runway urgency, standard-slot context) and direct handoff link to Two-Way Utility.
    - Rebuilt `web/app/views/entities/teams/_section_apron_provenance.html.erb` into provenance lanes that surface trigger reason, apron level, A1/A2 transaction lineage, and active constraints in one scan path.
    - Updated `web/app/views/entities/teams/show.html.erb` and `web/app/controllers/entities/teams_sse_controller.rb` section ordering to keep the operational flow contiguous (`activity` → `two-way` → `apron-provenance`) in both initial render and bootstrap.
    - Added focused coverage in `web/test/integration/entities_teams_show_test.rb` asserting lane rendering, no table markup in the three target sections, key causal labels, and preserved pivots.
  - Why this improves the flow:
    - Team operators can now read each operational row as one causal line (action source + references + cap/tax/apron effect) without horizontal table scanning.
    - Two-way decisions are tied to explicit runway urgency and immediately connected to downstream tools, reducing context-switch friction.
    - Apron provenance now reads as a decision chain (reason → level → constraints → triggering tx), making “why this restriction exists” answerable at a glance.
  - Acceptance criteria:
    - No `<table>` markup remains in the three target team section partials.
    - Rows expose event/action → cap/tax/apron consequence in one line of sight.
    - Related pivots (player/transaction/trade) are preserved or improved.
  - Rubric (before → after):
    - Scan speed: 3 → 5
    - Information hierarchy: 3 → 5
    - Interaction predictability: 4 → 5
    - Density/readability: 3 → 4
    - Navigation/pivots: 4 → 5
  - Follow-up tasks discovered:
    - Add quick lane filters in activity (`cap only`, `tax only`, `apron only`) to shrink long ledgers without leaving the section.
    - Add cross-highlighting between apron provenance rows and matching activity transactions (shared transaction ID emphasis) for instant cause tracing.
  - Guardrails:
    - Do not modify Salary Book files.

- [x] [P1] [ENTITY] /transactions/:id — redesign from static record view to causal transaction timeline
  - Problem: Transaction detail is comprehensive but hard to parse causally (parties, ledger effects, artifacts are separated and table-dense).
  - Hypothesis: Timeline-style lanes with explicit cause/effect chips will make transaction interpretation much faster.
  - Scope (files):
    - web/app/views/entities/transactions/show.html.erb
    - web/test/integration/entities_transactions_show_test.rb
  - What changed (files):
    - Rebuilt `web/app/views/entities/transactions/show.html.erb` into a single causal timeline section that reads in ordered phases (`1 · Transaction facts` → `2 · Parties + routing` → `3 · Ledger deltas` → `4 · Cap artifacts`) using dense lane rows instead of table blocks.
    - Added per-lane cause/effect metric cells (`Cap Δ`, `Tax Δ`, `Apron Δ`, `MTS Δ`) and surfaced direct pivots (team/player/transaction/trade) inside each lane so users can move from interpretation to drill-in without context loss.
    - Reworked trade context and endnotes into lane grammar to keep the same scan model throughout the page rather than falling back to nested tables.
    - Added focused integration coverage in `web/test/integration/entities_transactions_show_test.rb` asserting timeline phase labels, no `<table>` markup in primary timeline/trade sections, and presence of team/player/trade/transaction pivots.
  - Why this improves the flow:
    - Users now follow one explicit narrative path from “what happened” to “who it touched” to “financial consequences” to “cap artifacts,” reducing section-jumping and mental stitching.
    - Every lane now carries immediate related pivots, so the transaction page behaves like a decision dossier instead of a static audit dump.
    - Dense lane grammar preserves information density while making chronology and causality legible in one vertical scan.
  - Acceptance criteria:
    - Page presents chronological/causal lane from transaction facts → parties → ledger deltas → cap artifacts.
    - Core sections avoid large table blocks for primary read path.
    - “Open related trade/player/team” pivots are visible in each lane.
  - Rubric (before → after):
    - Scan speed: 2 → 5
    - Information hierarchy: 3 → 5
    - Interaction predictability: 4 → 5
    - Density/readability: 3 → 4
    - Navigation/pivots: 4 → 5
  - Follow-up tasks discovered:
    - Add timeline lane filters (`facts`, `parties`, `ledger`, `artifacts`) with URL-persisted state for very large transactions.
    - Add optional “show raw warehouse rows” expansion beneath each phase for audit/debug workflows without polluting the default primary scan path.
  - Guardrails:
    - Do not modify Salary Book files.

- [x] [P1] [ENTITY] /trades/:id — reframe trade detail as team-centric OUT/IN impact board
  - Problem: Trade detail contains rich data but requires too much table scanning to understand team-by-team directionality.
  - Hypothesis: Team-centric OUT/IN lanes with net impact cues will reduce drill burden and improve legal/cap interpretation.
  - Scope (files):
    - web/app/views/entities/trades/show.html.erb
    - web/test/integration/entities_trades_show_test.rb
  - What changed (files):
    - Rebuilt `#leg-breakdown` in `web/app/views/entities/trades/show.html.erb` from a single summary table into a team-centric impact board with per-team OUT/IN/net cues, salary/cash deltas, and inline asset lanes.
    - Added team-level lane composition logic at the top of `show.html.erb` to aggregate outgoing/incoming players, picks, cash, and related transactions so each team lane reads as one impact snapshot.
    - Rebuilt `#trade-groups` in `show.html.erb` into legal lanes (by group + team) that keep signed-method + generated/acquired exception context in the same row grammar, plus a lane-style team exception registry.
    - Added focused integration coverage in `web/test/integration/entities_trades_show_test.rb` asserting no table markup in `#leg-breakdown`/`#trade-groups`, visibility of OUT/IN/net cues, and preserved player/pick/transaction/team pivots.
  - Why this improves the flow:
    - Users now start with directionality (OUT vs IN vs net) per team before drilling into raw row audits, eliminating the previous “decode tables first” step.
    - Asset pivots (player, pick, transaction) are now embedded directly in each team lane, so analysis stays team-contextual rather than bouncing across isolated sections.
    - Legal trade-group interpretation is now aligned with the same team lane grammar, making cap-legal context readable without switching scanning modes.
  - Acceptance criteria:
    - Leg breakdown and trade-group sections are readable in team-centric lane grammar.
    - OUT/IN/net cues are visible before reading deep details.
    - Transaction, player, and pick pivots are preserved in each lane.
  - Rubric (before → after):
    - Scan speed: 2 → 5
    - Information hierarchy: 3 → 5
    - Interaction predictability: 4 → 5
    - Density/readability: 3 → 4
    - Navigation/pivots: 4 → 5
  - Follow-up tasks discovered:
    - Add lane-level toggles (`assets only`, `transactions only`, `legal only`) with URL-persisted state for large multi-team trades.
    - Add explicit TPE direction mapping (OUT vs IN) once warehouse rows expose directional exception flow in trade details.
  - Guardrails:
    - Do not modify Salary Book files.

- [x] [P2] [ENTITY] /agencies/:slug — de-table roster/distribution/historical sections into flex lanes
  - Problem: Agency detail remained table-dominant, which slowed cross-agent + cross-team footprint scanning.
  - Hypothesis: Dense flex lanes with rollup-aware headers would improve fast triage and preserve pivots.
  - Scope (implemented files):
    - web/app/views/entities/agencies/show.html.erb
    - web/test/integration/entities_agencies_show_test.rb
  - Patch targets: `#maincanvas` (entity show section stack)
  - Response type: full-page `text/html` show render (`Entities::AgenciesController#show`)
  - What changed (files):
    - Rebuilt `show.html.erb` roster/team/historical primary read paths from `<table>` markup into lane grammar (`entity-cell-two-line` rows + dense flex metric cells) while keeping existing section anchors (`#agent-roster`, `#team-distribution`, `#historical`).
    - Added rollup-first section headers for each target block (agent counts with active/inactive posture, represented team/client/cap totals, season range + top-client cap totals) so scan starts with concentration signals before row detail.
    - Converted historical subsections (“Book by season”, “Top clients by cap (2025)”) to lane rows with inline intensity bars and preserved direct player/agent/team pivots.
    - Added team slug prefetch on agency show to keep team pivots canonical when available.
    - Added focused integration coverage in `entities_agencies_show_test.rb` asserting lane rendering, absence of `<table>` in target sections, stable anchors, and preserved `/agents` + `/players` + `/teams` links.
  - Why this improves the flow:
    - The agency footprint now reads in one vertical lane grammar across roster → distribution → history, reducing table-mode switching.
    - Rollup headers expose where concentration/risk sits before users drill into row-level details.
    - Direct pivots stay embedded in every row, so users can jump to agent/player/team context without leaving scan momentum.
  - Rubric (before → after):
    - Scan speed: 3 → 5
    - Information hierarchy: 3 → 5
    - Interaction predictability: 4 → 5
    - Density/readability: 3 → 4
    - Navigation/pivots: 4 → 5
  - Follow-up tasks discovered:
    - Add optional historical lens toggles (`cap` / `tax` / `apron`) to reduce cognitive load on long season ranges.
    - Add cohort slices inside agency roster lanes (`max-level`, `expiring`, `restricted`) for faster negotiation-risk triage at agency scope.
  - Guardrails:
    - Do not modify Salary Book files.

- [x] [P2] [ENTITY] /draft-selections/:slug — convert provenance section to severity-first chain lanes
  - Problem: Draft selection detail still buries provenance complexity in a table.
  - Hypothesis: Severity-first chain lanes (clean / with trade / deep chain) will make ownership risk obvious immediately.
  - Scope (files):
    - web/app/views/entities/draft_selections/show.html.erb
    - web/test/integration/entities_draft_selections_show_test.rb
  - Patch targets: `#maincanvas` (`#provenance` section on entity show)
  - Response type: full-page `text/html` show render (`Entities::DraftSelectionsController#show`)
  - What changed (files):
    - Rebuilt `web/app/views/entities/draft_selections/show.html.erb` provenance section from table markup into severity-first chain lanes ordered as `Deep chain → With trade → Clean`, with a top risk snapshot chip row (`Clean/With trade/Deep chain`) and chain depth signal (`P0+`).
    - Added lane-level chain rendering with hop markers (`P1`, `P2`, ...), explicit `From → To` route cells, one-click trade pivots, date visibility, and inline flag chips (`swap`, `future`, `conditional`, conditional type).
    - Preserved and foregrounded transaction/trade pivots at section footer so canonical transaction context remains one click from provenance scan.
    - Added focused integration coverage in `web/test/integration/entities_draft_selections_show_test.rb` asserting severity lane labels, absence of `<table>` in `#provenance`, route legibility (`From → To`), and preserved `/transactions`, `/trades`, and `/teams` pivots.
  - Why this improves the flow:
    - Provenance complexity is now triaged by severity first, so contested ownership chains surface immediately instead of requiring horizontal table parsing.
    - Chain hops now read as a vertical causal story (hop/date/route/flags) with direct links, reducing back-and-forth interpretation effort.
    - The same section now supports both quick risk scan (lane headers/chips) and detailed audit (hop rows) without leaving page context.

    - Scan speed: 3 → 5
    - Information hierarchy: 3 → 5
    - Interaction predictability: 4 → 5
    - Density/readability: 3 → 4
    - Navigation/pivots: 4 → 5
  - Follow-up tasks discovered:
    - Add optional lane filter chips (`all`, `deep only`, `conditional only`) with URL-stable state for very long historical chains.
    - Add cross-highlight between provenance hops and matching trade rows on `/trades/:id` once shared chain identifiers are exposed in the detail payload.

- [ ] [P2] [ENTITY] /draft-picks/:slug — redesign protections + trade chain into rule lanes and chain map
  - Problem: Draft pick detail is thorough but table-heavy and hard to interpret quickly under conditional complexity.
  - Hypothesis: Rule-oriented lanes plus compact chain map will improve comprehension of protections/swaps.
  - Scope (files):
    - web/app/views/entities/draft_picks/show.html.erb
    - web/test/integration/entities_draft_picks_show_test.rb
  - Acceptance criteria:
    - Protection details and trade chain sections use lane grammar with explicit conditional/swap flags.
    - Counterparty/original-owner context is visible without row-by-row table parsing.
    - Trade/team pivots remain immediate.

- [ ] [P2] [TOOL] /tools/system-values — add keyboard-first metric finder shortlist
  - Problem: Finder works, but still biases pointer-heavy selection for known metrics.
  - Hypothesis: Ranked typeahead + Enter open will complete find-and-open in one flow.
  - Scope (files):
    - web/app/controllers/tools/system_values_controller.rb
    - web/app/views/tools/system_values/_commandbar.html.erb
    - web/app/views/tools/system_values/show.html.erb
    - web/test/integration/tools_system_values_test.rb
  - Acceptance criteria:
    - Finder supports keyboard shortlist + Enter to open selected metric overlay.
    - Finder/overlay/URL state stay synchronized after refresh.
    - No regressions in existing section visibility URL behavior.
  - Rubric (before → target):
    - Scan speed: 4 → 5

- [ ] [P3] [PROCESS] design loop hygiene — enforce commit title schema and forbidden Salary Book path guard
  - Problem: Recent history includes inconsistent commit naming and historical risk of forbidden Salary Book path touches.
  - Hypothesis: Hard checks in loop/supervisor step will reduce drift and cleanup churn.
  - Scope (files):
    - agents/design.ts
    - web/app/views/tools/salary_book/_maincanvas_tankathon_frame.html.erb (allow-list reference only)
  - Acceptance criteria:
    - Commit title schema enforced (`design: [TRACK] /surface flow-outcome`) for worker commits.
    - Loop rejects diffs touching Salary Book files outside approved Tankathon file.
    - Failure mode is explicit and logged in supervision output.
  - Rubric (before → target):
    - Scan speed: 3 → 3
    - Information hierarchy: 4 → 4
    - Interaction predictability: 3 → 5
    - Density/readability: 4 → 4
    - Navigation/pivots: 3 → 3
  - Guardrails:
    - Salary Book exception: only edit `web/app/views/tools/salary_book/_maincanvas_tankathon_frame.html.erb`.
    - Do not modify any other Salary Book files/controllers/helpers/tests.
