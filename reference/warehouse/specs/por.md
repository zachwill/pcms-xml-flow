# POR (Playground snapshot) — stub

**Source:** `reference/warehouse/por.json`

`por.json` is a **saved view** of the Salary Book with `D1 = "POR"` and is otherwise **identical** to `playground.json`.

- Canonical spec: [`playground.md`](playground.md)
- Shared formula patterns: [`patterns.md`](patterns.md)

No unique logic lives here.
