# BuiltWith — Technology Usage Trend Page

## Overview

### Description
Tracks adoption of a specific web technology over time, summarizes current footprint by segments (traffic tiers, countries, economic groups), and connects the data to an action: downloading targeted lead lists.

### Main UI Patterns
- Dashboard: Two-column layout with a primary trend chart and a dense summary sidebar
- Data cards: Stacked contextual cards under the chart
- Control panel: Checkbox legend to toggle series
- Global nav/search: Header with universal search, language selection, and deep breadcrumbs

### Notes
- Pairs an at-a-glance trend chart with always-visible, scannable numerics
- Keeps a conversion action ("Download Lead List") persistent without interrupting exploration
- Adds relational context (complementary technologies) that shifts from "how much" to "used with what," opening direct, niche conversion paths

## Key Modules

### 1. Global Header, Language, and Search
- Description: Offers immediate wayfinding (language selector, search) for a global, deep-site experience
- Core Elements:
  - Utility header with Log In/Signup and language selector
  - Primary nav with Tools/Features/Resources, Plans, Customers, and an integrated search bar
- Interaction Patterns:
  - Direct-entry search as a primary interaction; dropdown navigation for exploration
- Notes:
  - Search-in-header reduces time-to-answer for users arriving with specific intent

### 2. Orientation: Breadcrumbs and H1
- Description: Grounds users in a deep hierarchy and confirms page topic at a glance
- Core Elements:
  - Breadcrumb trail (e.g., Home > Trends > Frameworks > Ruby on Rails Usage Statistics)
  - Large H1 with the technology name and context (usage statistics)
- Interaction Patterns:
  - Breadcrumb links support quick backtracking and lateral exploration

### 3. Trend Chart with Interactive Legend
- Description: The primary way to see adoption over time and compare across segments
- Core Elements:
  - Long-range line chart (2011–2025)
  - Checkbox legend for segments like Top 10k, Top 100k, Top 1m, All sites
- Interaction Patterns:
  - Toggle series on/off to simplify the view or focus on specific tiers
- Notes:
  - The legend-as-filter pattern lowers friction compared to a separate filter pane

### 4. Context Cards Under the Chart

#### 4.1 Technology Summary
- Description: Gives a compact definition and canonical link to reduce ambiguity
- Core Elements:
  - Short description and link to official homepage
- Interaction Patterns:
  - One-click out for validation or deeper technical details

#### 4.2 Lead Generation CTA
- Description: Converts interest in the trend into an actionable list (sites using the tech)
- Core Elements:
  - Count of sites in database
  - Prominent "Download Lead List" button
- Interaction Patterns:
  - Clear primary action aligned to the page’s main job-to-be-done (prospecting)

#### 4.3 Complementary Technologies
- Description: Surfaces co-usage relationships to power more targeted lists and insights
- Core Elements:
  - List of frequently co-installed technologies with counts and direct download links
- Interaction Patterns:
  - Click to pivot into a more specific segment (e.g., "Rails + Postgres" list)
- Notes:
  - Turns relational insights into immediate actions without extra filtering work

#### 4.4 Awards/Rankings
- Description: Benchmarks popularity position across site tiers/categories
- Core Elements:
  - Rank positions (e.g., 20th in Top 1M)
- Interaction Patterns:
  - Passive scan; supports comparative reasoning and credibility

### 5. Right Sidebar: Summary + Deep Slices

#### 5.1 Persistent CTA + Data Summary
- Description: Keeps the conversion action visible and contextualizes the dataset in text
- Core Elements:
  - Repeated "Download Lead List" button
  - Short descriptive paragraph summarizing key stats
- Interaction Patterns:
  - "Always within reach" action; skim-friendly copy

#### 5.2 Site Totals
- Description: Fast scan of headline counts (live, historical, country key stats)
- Core Elements:
  - Live vs historical site counts
  - Notable country breakdowns
- Interaction Patterns:
  - Passive scan; anchors the magnitude of the dataset

#### 5.3 Traffic Tier Breakdown
- Description: Segments adoption by site importance (Top 1m/100k/10k) with absolute and percentage values
- Core Elements:
  - Tier names
  - Percentages and counts for each tier
- Interaction Patterns:
  - Visual hierarchy for "where it matters most"

#### 5.4 Granular Lists (By Country; By Economic Group)
- Description: Offers pre-sliced geographic and macroeconomic segments for quick drill-downs
- Core Elements:
  - Country list with flags
  - Groupings like APAC, BRICS, EMEA, G7
- Interaction Patterns:
  - Scroll lists; click-through to dedicated segment pages or lead lists
- Notes:
  - Encodes expert domain groupings so users don’t need to assemble them manually

#### 5.5 Secondary Navigation (Related Technology Groups)
- Description: Encourages lateral exploration within the taxonomy
- Core Elements:
  - List of related groups/categories
- Interaction Patterns:
  - Sideways browsing within the ecosystem

## Best Ideas

### 1. Dual-Track Presentation: Visual Trend + Numeric Sidebar
- Name and Description: Parallel delivery for two modes: visual pattern recognition and precise numeric lookup
- Why It Works: Reduces context switching; users get both macro trend and micro stats without navigating away
- Where It Breaks Down: Risk of competing focal points on smaller screens; requires strong visual hierarchy
- Notes: Keep chart interactions lightweight; keep sidebar scannable with consistent labeling

### 2. Tier-Based Segmentation (Top 10k/100k/1m)
- Name and Description: Shows adoption distribution across importance tiers, not just totals
- Why It Works: Encodes a quality dimension into otherwise flat counts; clarifies where the tech matters
- Where It Breaks Down: If tier definitions or data sources aren’t explained, users may misinterpret the segments

### 3. Complementary Technologies as Actionable Pivots
- Name and Description: Lists co-usage pairs (e.g., Rails + Postgres) with one-click paths to targeted lists
- Why It Works: Relational context reveals stack patterns and enables more precise prospecting
- Where It Breaks Down: Without co-usage methodology or thresholds, lists can appear arbitrary or noisy

### 4. Persistent, Aligned CTA
- Name and Description: The primary action ("Download Lead List") appears near every major data block
- Why It Works: Keeps the next step obvious and reduces scrolling to act
- Where It Breaks Down: Overexposure can feel pushy; redundant buttons need clear visual priority

### 5. Prebuilt Geographic and Macroeconomic Slices
- Name and Description: Ready-made filters (countries, APAC, G7, etc.) for expert needs
- Why It Works: Saves users from assembling complex segments; standardizes analysis across users
- Where It Breaks Down: Group definitions evolve; needs maintenance and transparent labeling

### 6. Deep-Site Orientation (Breadcrumbs + H1 + Global Search)
- Name and Description: Strong wayfinding stack for large taxonomies
- Why It Works: Reduces disorientation in deep hierarchies and shortens time-to-content
- Where It Breaks Down: If breadcrumb levels aren’t meaningful, users won’t trust or use them

## Metadata

### Data Density
High. Long-range time series, multiple tiers, and several sliced lists. Balanced with scannable modules and repeated summaries.

### Notable Omissions
Not visible in the analysis:
- Methodology details (definitions of "live," "historical," sources for traffic tiers, update cadence)
- Time-range controls (zoom, custom ranges) and chart annotations
- Data export beyond lead lists (CSV/API for the trend or breakdowns)
- Saved views, shareable links, or permalinks with applied filters
- Accessibility specifics (colorblind-safe palettes, chart ARIA/alt descriptions)
- Mobile handling of the two-column layout and dense lists

### Misc Notes
- The legend-as-filter is a low-friction way to compare tiers without a separate filter UI
- Repeating the CTA in both columns keeps conversion proximate to insight, which is reusable for any analytics-to-action workflow (e.g., "Add to list," "Create report," "Compare X vs Y")
