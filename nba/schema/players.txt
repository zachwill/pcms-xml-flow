### nba.players

#### Constraints & Indexes
- UNIQUE (nba_id)
- INDEX (current_team_id)
- INDEX (full_name)
- INDEX (player_slug)

#### Mapping Decisions & Notes
- **Source:** Data primarily from `nba/api/nba-stats.txt` -> `/api/stats/player/index`.
- **Identity:** `nba_id` is the authoritative identifier. `ngss_person_id` is stored to facilitate joins with legacy NGSS datasets.
- **Physicals:** `height` and `weight` are stored as text (e.g., '6-2', '200') as provided by the source API to maintain fidelity, as conversions to numeric formats (inches/lbs) can be lossy or inconsistent across providers.
- **Slug:** `player_slug` is derived from the source (sometimes called `player_code`) and is essential for UI/linking patterns identified in `nba/inspiration/bref.txt`.
- **Active Context:** Includes `current_team_id` and `current_team_tricode` for the most common "current roster" query patterns, even if these values change frequently.
