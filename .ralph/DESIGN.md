# Design Evolution Backlog (`web/`)

North star:
- Entity index pages are explorer workbenches (Salary Book-like interaction model, not clones).
- Fast scanning, meaningful knobs, dense interactive rows, and sidebar drill-ins.
- Canonical pattern: `#commandbar` + `#maincanvas` + `#rightpanel-base` + `#rightpanel-overlay`.
- Salary Book remains read-only and is the interaction quality bar.
- Team Summary, System Values, and Two-Way Utility evolve in parallel toward stronger workbench UX.

Rubric (1-5):
1) Scan speed
2) Information hierarchy
3) Interaction predictability
4) Density/readability balance
5) Navigation/pivots

Current focus reset (2026-02-12):
- Push index surfaces away from `<table>` rendering toward dense flex-row workbench grammar.
- Two-Way Utility row anatomy is the nearest non-Salary-Book reference for this migration.
- Salary Book Tankathon table-to-flex migration is now enabled as a strict exception (only the Tankathon frame partial; no other Salary Book files).

Supervisor review (2026-02-13):
- Reviewed: `.ralph/DESIGN.md`, `web/AGENTS.md`, `web/docs/design_guide.md`, `web/docs/datastar_sse_playbook.md`, `reference/sites/INTERACTION_MODELS.md`, plus recent commits (`git log --oneline -8`) and changed web scope (`git diff --name-only HEAD~4 -- web/`).
- Result: recent commits are flow-level and mostly cleanly scoped to one surface at a time.
  - INDEX convergence: `/teams`, `/agencies`, `/drafts` moved toward explorer-workbench behavior (sectioned lanes, severity-first scan cues, dense flex rows, sidebar tie-back).
  - TOOL evolution: Salary Book touched only the approved Tankathon partial and improved row interaction parity (including keyboard activation).
- Datastar boundary/response checks: multi-region updates remain single SSE responses with canonical targets (`#commandbar`, `#maincanvas`/results, `#rightpanel-base`, `#rightpanel-overlay`) and correct signal patching.
- Guardrail check: no forbidden Salary Book/controller/helper/test edits detected in reviewed commits.
- Drift note: commit `4b323c7` message is not surface+flow explicit; keep commit naming strict so review traceability stays high.
- Corrective TODOs for next loop:
  - Every commit title should encode track + surface + flow outcome (e.g., `design: [INDEX] /transactions date-grouped triage lanes`).
  - Keep prioritizing interaction outcomes (scan speed, wayfinding, drill-in predictability) over styling-only churn.

- [x] [P1] [INDEX] /agents — replace table rendering with flex-row workspace and compress Sort controls
  - Problem: `/agents` still uses table markup for both agents/agencies lenses, and the commandbar Sort cluster is too wide/noisy to scan quickly.
  - Hypothesis: A dense flex-row list plus a compact Sort selector + stacked Direction control will improve scan speed and reduce commandbar crowding.
  - What changed:
    - Added a dedicated agents commandbar partial (`web/app/views/entities/agents/_commandbar.html.erb`) and switched `index.html.erb` to render it so commandbar behavior/markup is shared between initial load and SSE refresh.
    - Compressed Sort controls in `/agents` commandbar: replaced long sort-key radio run with a compact `select` (`#agent-sort-key-select`) and stacked direction radios in the same Sort knob column.
    - Extended shared entity commandbar renderer (`web/app/views/entities/shared/_commandbar.html.erb`) with a `select` knob type (`choices`, `width_class`, `data-bind`, `on_change`) to support compact control patterns.
    - Rebuilt `/agents` workspace main list (`web/app/views/entities/agents/_workspace_main.html.erb`) for both agents and agencies lenses as dense div/flex rows with sticky headers; removed table markup entirely while preserving row click/open-overlay behavior and overlay highlight states.
    - Updated agents SSE refresh (`web/app/controllers/entities/agents_sse_controller.rb`) to patch `#commandbar` together with maincanvas/sidebar/overlay so knob markup and state stay synchronized after lens/sort changes.
    - Updated integration coverage (`web/test/integration/entities_agents_index_test.rb`) to assert compact sort select presence, commandbar patching in SSE response, and no entity table markup in `/agents` index response.
  - Why this improves the flow:
    - Scan rhythm is now consistent with newer workbench surfaces: dense flex rows, fixed column grammar, and faster eye-tracking across rows.
    - Sort control footprint is materially smaller, reducing commandbar crowding and making directional intent clearer in one stacked knob column.
    - One SSE response now keeps commandbar + maincanvas + sidebar + overlay aligned, which improves interaction predictability during rapid filter/sort toggling.
  - Verification:
    - `cd web && bundle exec ruby -Itest test/integration/entities_agents_index_test.rb -i "/agents refresh|agency overlay exposes/"`
    - `rg "<table" web/app/views/entities/agents/_workspace_main.html.erb`

    - Information hierarchy: 3 → 5
    - Interaction predictability: 4 → 5
    - Density/readability: 4 → 4
    - Navigation/pivots: 4 → 5
  - Follow-up tasks discovered:
    - Full-page `/agents` integration assertion path still hits the known `tailwind.css` test asset load-path issue; keep running targeted SSE/integration subsets until that harness issue is resolved.
    - Consider extracting a shared entity flex-row metric cell partial once `/agencies` migrates to reduce duplicated percentile/value cell markup.
  - Guardrails:
    - Do not modify Salary Book files.

- [x] [P1] [INDEX] /players — shift from single table-rail scan to sectioned flex rows (Two-Way Utility style)
  - Problem: `/players` remained visually table-like (single rigid rail + dense numeric columns), which made long scans feel spreadsheet-heavy instead of workbench-oriented.
  - Hypothesis: Sectioned flex rows (with lightweight section headers) would preserve density while improving orientation and reducing cognitive reset during long scans.
  - What changed:
    - Added section-bucketing state in `web/app/controllers/entities/players_controller.rb`:
      - introduced ordered player section definitions (status and constraint buckets),
      - grouped filtered rows into `@player_sections`,
      - computed per-section row/team counts plus aligned cap/total rollups for header context.
    - Reworked `web/app/views/entities/players/_workspace_main.html.erb` from one uninterrupted lane to explicit section blocks:
      - kept the existing global sticky column header,
      - added sticky per-section headers (`top-8`) with section title/subtitle and cap rollups aligned to the same cap columns as row cells,
      - preserved existing dense row anatomy, row click→overlay flow, and Pin A/Pin B controls.
    - Expanded integration coverage in `web/test/integration/entities_players_index_test.rb` to assert section container/header presence in SSE refresh payloads and active-lens section routing (`trade_kicker` bucket precedence).
  - Why this improves the flow:
    - Long scans now re-anchor at each section boundary instead of forcing one continuous spreadsheet pass.
    - Sticky section headers keep posture context visible while preserving numeric column alignment for cap comparison.
    - Compare and overlay mechanics stay unchanged, so interaction predictability remains high while hierarchy improves.
  - Verification:
    - `cd web && bundle exec ruby -Itest test/integration/entities_players_index_test.rb -i "/players refresh uses one sse response|players refresh applies trade kicker constraint with horizon-aware cap labels|players refresh pin action updates compare slots without forcing overlay selection/"`

    - Interaction predictability: 4 → 5
    - Density/readability: 4 → 4
    - Navigation/pivots: 4 → 5
  - Follow-up tasks discovered:
    - Full-page `/players` integration assertions still hit the known `tailwind.css` test asset load-path issue; continue using focused SSE subsets until harness setup is fixed.
    - Consider extracting a shared section-header partial once `/teams` adopts sectioned cap lanes to reduce duplicated rollup-header markup.
  - Guardrails:
    - Do not modify Salary Book files.

- [x] [P1] [INDEX] /teams — reframe cap-pressure rows into sectioned flex lanes instead of table-like striping
  - Problem: `/teams` rows were dense/useful but still read as one flat pass, which made pressure triage feel like spreadsheet scanning instead of lane-based workbench analysis.
  - Hypothesis: Pressure-bucket section lanes with sticky lane headers would improve first-pass orientation while preserving compare + overlay flows.
  - What changed:
    - Added pressure-lane section state in `web/app/controllers/entities/teams_controller.rb`:
      - introduced ordered pressure section definitions,
      - grouped filtered teams into `@team_sections`,
      - computed per-section rollups (cap/tax/apron/tax-owed + roster + taxpayer/repeater counts).
    - Reworked `web/app/views/entities/teams/_workspace_main.html.erb` from one continuous lane to sectioned pressure lanes:
      - kept the existing global sticky column header,
      - added sticky lane headers (`top-8`) with lane title/subtitle and numeric rollups aligned to row columns,
      - preserved row hover, row click → overlay, and Pin A/Pin B compare actions.
    - Updated `web/app/views/entities/teams/_rightpanel_base.html.erb` to surface “Pressure lanes in view” counts so sidebar posture mirrors the sectioned board.
    - Expanded integration coverage in `web/test/integration/entities_teams_index_test.rb` for section container presence and lens-driven section routing.
  - Why this improves the flow:
    - Pressure transitions are now explicit while scrolling, reducing cognitive reset during long scans.
    - Lane headers keep cap/tax/apron context anchored with aligned totals, which improves triage speed without sacrificing density.
    - Compare slots, selected-row highlighting, and sidebar drill-ins remain unchanged, preserving interaction predictability.
  - Verification:
    - `cd web && bundle exec ruby -Itest test/integration/entities_teams_index_test.rb -i "/teams refresh|teams sidebar/"`

    - Interaction predictability: 4 → 5
    - Density/readability: 5 → 5
    - Navigation/pivots: 4 → 5
  - Follow-up tasks discovered:
    - Full-page `/teams` index integration assertions still hit the known `tailwind.css` test asset load-path issue; continue focused SSE subsets until harness setup is fixed.
    - Consider extracting shared section-header/row partials between `/players` and `/teams` after the next index migration to reduce duplicated lane markup.
  - Guardrails:
    - Do not modify Salary Book files.

- [x] [P1] [INDEX] /agencies — migrate agency explorer from table markup to flex-row workbench scan
  - Problem: `/agencies` was still table-rendered, which broke visual consistency with newer workbench-style index surfaces and slowed row-level triage.
  - Hypothesis: A flex-row workspace with the same identity/metric grammar as `/agents` and Two-Way Utility would improve scan continuity and make pivots more predictable.
  - What changed:
    - Rebuilt `web/app/views/entities/agencies/_workspace_main.html.erb` from `<table>` markup to dense flex-row workbench rows with a sticky column header (`#agencies-flex-header`).
    - Preserved agency row interaction grammar (row click/keyboard open overlay, selected-row highlight treatment, and row-level canonical page pivots).
    - Kept numeric metric columns in `font-mono tabular-nums` and retained percentile secondary lines via `entity-cell-two-line` cells.
    - Added lightweight workspace scan chips in the maincanvas header (live books / inactive+live / live risk) to front-load posture context before drill-in.
    - Updated `web/test/integration/entities_agencies_index_test.rb` assertions to verify the flex header is present and `<table>` markup is absent in both index and SSE refresh responses.
  - Why this improves the flow:
    - Agency scanning now matches the newer entity workbench grammar (sticky compact header + dense flex rows), improving continuity across index surfaces.
    - Posture chips and row-level status tokens make triage intent visible before opening the overlay.
    - Overlay/pivot behavior remains stable, so analysts gain faster scan speed without relearning interactions.
  - Verification:
    - `cd web && bundle exec ruby -Itest test/integration/entities_agencies_index_test.rb -i "/agencies refresh|agencies sidebar overlay/"`

  - Guardrails:
    - Do not modify Salary Book files.

- [x] [P1] [INDEX] /drafts — de-table grid/list views and make ownership risk severity visible before drill-in
  - Problem: `/drafts` still relied on table-heavy rendering across grid/picks/selections, and users had to click repeatedly to discover high-risk ownership contexts.
  - Hypothesis: Moving all three views to dense flex-row workbench grammar plus explicit severity encoding would improve shortlist speed before drill-in.
  - Scope (files):
    - web/app/controllers/entities/drafts_controller.rb
    - web/app/views/entities/drafts/_results.html.erb
    - web/app/views/entities/drafts/_rightpanel_base.html.erb
    - web/test/integration/entities_pane_endpoints_test.rb
  - What changed:
    - Added shared risk-tier derivation in `DraftsController` for picks and selections (`normal` / `at_risk` / `critical`) and propagated tier label state into row payloads.
    - Unified sidebar severity accounting across picks/selections/grid via shared tier-count logic so in-row treatment and sidebar KPI counts use the same underlying rules.
    - Rebuilt `web/app/views/entities/drafts/_results.html.erb` to remove table markup entirely:
      - grid now renders as flex row bands with sticky team rail + year columns,
      - picks and selections now render as dense flex-row lists with sticky headers,
      - all three views surface tier chips + compact risk score context before overlay open.
    - Added a consistent ownership-risk legend in-surface (all draft views) and mirrored tier explainer copy in `#rightpanel-base`.
    - Preserved existing row/cell click → overlay behavior and selected-overlay restoration semantics in SSE refresh.
    - Expanded integration assertions for flex headers and de-table rendering checks on drafts pane/SSE paths.
  - Why this improves the flow:
    - Ownership contention severity is now legible at glance in grid, picks, and selections without opening overlays.
    - De-tabled flex lanes match the newer index workbench scan grammar, improving rhythm and wayfinding consistency.
    - Shared tier logic between rows and sidebar reduces interpretation drift and keeps triage trustworthy during lens/sort changes.
  - Verification:
    - `cd web && bundle exec ruby -Itest test/integration/entities_pane_endpoints_test.rb -i "/drafts pane responds successfully|drafts grid refresh surfaces ownership risk tiers before drill-in|drafts refresh uses one sse response for multi-region patches|drafts refresh preserves selected selection overlay when row remains visible|drafts refresh preserves selected pick overlay and normalizes key for grid view/"`

    - Interaction predictability: 4 → 5
    - Density/readability: 4 → 4
    - Navigation/pivots: 4 → 5
  - Follow-up tasks discovered:
    - Add one-click year pivot actions directly on grid column headers (currently year pivot remains in commandbar/overlay paths).
    - Consider de-tabling draft pick/selection provenance tables inside sidebar overlays for full main/overlay grammar alignment.
    - Local full-page index integration still depends on fixing the `tailwind.css` test asset load-path setup.
  - Guardrails:
    - Do not modify Salary Book files.

- [x] [P2] [TOOL] /tools/two-way-utility — add intent search to find one player fast without leaving team-section context
  - Problem: Users scanning many team sections cannot quickly jump to a known player name/id.
  - Hypothesis: Commandbar intent search with in-context filtering/highlighting will cut navigation time while preserving workbench density.
  - Scope (files):
    - web/app/controllers/tools/two_way_utility_controller.rb
    - web/app/views/tools/two_way_utility/show.html.erb
    - web/app/views/tools/two_way_utility/_commandbar.html.erb

    - web/app/views/tools/two_way_utility/_rightpanel_overlay_player.html.erb
    - web/test/integration/tools_two_way_utility_test.rb
  - What changed:
    - Added a dedicated Two-Way Utility commandbar partial and wired `/tools/two-way-utility/sse/refresh` to patch `#commandbar` + `#maincanvas` + `#rightpanel-base` + `#rightpanel-overlay` in one SSE response.
    - Added `intent` workspace state (controller + signals + URL sync + state query) so name/player_id search is shareable and preserved across refreshes.
    - Added commandbar player-intent controls (`#two-way-intent-input`, Apply/Clear) that drive SSE refresh without leaving team-section context.
    - Applied intent-aware board treatment: intent chips in workspace header/team sections, row-level highlight treatment, and inline `INTENT` status token.
    - Kept compare/overlay flows stable while migrating compare actions to canonical query keys (`compare_action`, `compare_slot`) with legacy fallback parsing in controller.
    - Updated overlay share link to retain active intent state.
    - Expanded integration coverage for intent filtering/highlight behavior, commandbar patching/signals, canonical compare params, and overlay-preservation behavior.
  - Why this improves the flow:
    - Analysts can jump directly to a known player from the commandbar and still read the result in-team, instead of manually scanning across sections.
    - Team grouping remains intact while matches are visibly emphasized, preserving orientation in dense board workflows.
    - One SSE refresh keeps commandbar, board, sidebar summary, compare slots, and overlay selection synchronized, improving predictability.

    - Navigation/pivots: 4 → 5
  - Follow-up tasks discovered:
    - Consider adding keyboard-first intent suggestions (top N matches) so experts can jump with one Enter without typing full names.
    - After all callers migrate, remove legacy `action`/`slot` compare fallback parsing from `TwoWayUtilityController`.
  - Guardrails:
    - Do not modify Salary Book files.

- [x] [P2] [TOOL] /tools/salary-book (Tankathon view only) — replace table board with Salary Book-style flex rows
  - Problem: Tankathon view still renders as a traditional table, which feels inconsistent with the Salary Book flex-row scanning grammar and slows visual comparison.
  - Hypothesis: Rebuilding Tankathon rows/cells as dense flex divs (matching Salary Book row anatomy) will improve scan rhythm while preserving one-click team switching.
  - Scope (files):
    - web/app/views/tools/salary_book/_maincanvas_tankathon_frame.html.erb
  - What changed:
    - Rebuilt the Tankathon standings board in `web/app/views/tools/salary_book/_maincanvas_tankathon_frame.html.erb` from `<table>` markup to a dense flex-row board with a fixed-width column rail and row-level identity cell anatomy.
    - Kept the existing `#salarybook-standings-table` patch/test anchor while switching to div primitives, so frame endpoint behavior and selector expectations remain stable.
    - Preserved row interaction semantics: each row still dispatches `salarybook-switch-team` with the current year, and now also supports Enter/Space keyboard activation for predictable row action parity.
    - Preserved active-team posture cues and strengthened visibility with an inline `Active` chip plus existing selected-row background/ring treatment.
  - Why this improves the flow:
    - Tankathon now scans with the same row rhythm as the rest of Salary Book (identity lane + compact numeric rails), reducing context switching between views.
    - Team identity and standings metrics remain aligned in one dense lane, improving at-a-glance comparison speed without sacrificing density.
    - Team-switch behavior is unchanged (and keyboard-complete), so users get higher scan quality without relearning interaction mechanics.

    - Consider adding sticky-left identity rails for Pick + Team if Tankathon adds materially more metric columns in a future expansion.

- [x] [P1] [INDEX] /transactions — support fast day-by-day feed triage with date-grouped scanning
  - Problem: Long transaction lists were flat, forcing users to repeatedly re-read dates while scanning.
  - Hypothesis: Date-group headers with stable row density improve temporal orientation and reduce cognitive load.
  - Scope (files):
    - web/app/controllers/entities/transactions_controller.rb
    - web/app/views/entities/transactions/_results.html.erb
    - web/app/views/entities/transactions/_rightpanel_base.html.erb
    - web/test/integration/entities_pane_endpoints_test.rb
  - What changed:
    - Added server-side date-lane grouping in `TransactionsController` (`@transaction_date_groups`) so transactions are rendered and summarized as day buckets in newest-first chronology.
    - Updated sidebar summary construction to produce grouped quick-feed lanes (`top_row_groups`) and keep selected-row inclusion stable without breaking chronological ordering.
    - Rebuilt `web/app/views/entities/transactions/_results.html.erb` from table markup to dense flex-row lanes with:
      - sticky global column header,
      - sticky per-day lane headers,
      - row anatomy that preserves existing row click/keyboard open-overlay behavior and selected-row highlight semantics,
      - intent-match cue display in-row.
    - Reworked `web/app/views/entities/transactions/_rightpanel_base.html.erb` quick feed into date-grouped sections so sidebar chronology mirrors main feed scanning.
    - Expanded transactions integration assertions in `entities_pane_endpoints_test.rb` to validate flex headers/date-lane markers, grouped quick-feed presence, and no table markup in transactions pane/SSE refresh responses.
  - Why this improves the flow:
    - Analysts can now scan by day lanes first, then triage rows within each lane, reducing repeated date re-parsing across long feeds.
    - Maincanvas and sidebar now share the same temporal grouping grammar, improving wayfinding and reducing context switching during drill-in.
    - Overlay selection/preservation behavior remains unchanged, so this improves hierarchy and scan speed without changing interaction expectations.

- [x] [P1] [INDEX] /trades — make team-in/team-out impact obvious from the list before opening overlay
  - Problem: Trade rows showed team count and asset totals, but not per-team directionality, forcing extra overlay opens to understand incoming/outgoing impact.
  - Hypothesis: Compact in-row OUT/IN team impact summaries would let users shortlist relevant deals before drill-in.
  - What changed:
    - Rebuilt `web/app/views/entities/trades/_results.html.erb` from table markup to dense flex rows with sticky header (`#trades-flex-header`) and preserved row click/keyboard overlay-open behavior.
    - Added inline team-impact modules per trade row (primary teams + overflow count) showing OUT vs IN flows and net direction chips (`Net in` / `Net out` / `Balanced`).
    - Extended trade index data preparation in `web/app/controllers/entities/trades_controller.rb`:
      - added `attach_trade_team_impacts!` to hydrate per-trade team flow counts (players/picks/cash/TPE) for visible rows,
      - attached `primary_team_impacts` and overflow metadata so main list and sidebar can render the same grammar.
    - Added shared impact-format helpers in `web/app/helpers/entities_helper.rb` (`trade_impact_flow_label`, `trade_impact_net_variant`, `trade_impact_net_label`) to keep OUT/IN phrasing consistent across surfaces.
    - Updated `web/app/views/entities/trades/_rightpanel_base.html.erb` quick deals to include the same impact grammar as list rows.
    - Expanded `web/test/integration/entities_pane_endpoints_test.rb` trades assertions and fake DB fixtures to validate flex header presence, OUT/IN impact cues, and no table markup in pane/SSE responses.
  - Why this improves the flow:
    - Team directionality is now visible at glance in the feed, reducing unnecessary overlay opens for basic triage.
    - Main list and quick deals use the same impact language, improving wayfinding continuity between canvas and sidebar.
    - Existing lens/filter/sort and overlay state behavior remain stable, so predictability is preserved while scan speed increases.

- [ ] [P2] [TOOL] /tools/system-values — jump directly to a metric and open drill-in in one flow

    - Choosing a metric scrolls to the relevant section/row and opens corresponding sidebar drill-in.
    - Overlay query params remain canonical and survive SSE refresh.
    - Existing section visibility toggles and scrollspy continue to work.

- [ ] [P1] [INDEX] /agents — allow agency-anchored narrowing while keeping agency overlay context
  - Problem: After opening an agency overlay, users still scan the full agent list and must mentally filter represented agents.
  - Hypothesis: A one-click “scope to active agency overlay” flow will reduce visual noise and speed agency-to-agent triage.
  - Scope (files):
    - web/app/views/entities/agents/index.html.erb
    - web/app/views/entities/agents/_workspace_main.html.erb
    - web/app/views/entities/agents/_rightpanel_base.html.erb
    - web/app/controllers/entities/agents_controller.rb
    - web/app/controllers/entities/agents_sse_controller.rb
    - web/test/integration/entities_agents_index_test.rb
  - Acceptance criteria:
    - When an agency overlay is active, users can toggle a scoped view showing only represented agents.
    - Scoped mode preserves agency overlay and keeps row highlight/tie-back cues.
    - Clearing scope returns to prior filters/sort without losing overlay state.
    - URL state captures scope mode for shareability.
  - Rubric (before → target):
    - Scan speed: 4 → 5
    - Information hierarchy: 4 → 5
    - Interaction predictability: 3 → 5
    - Density/readability: 4 → 4

- [ ] [P1] [INDEX] /draft-selections — make provenance severity legible at row glance for faster shortlist building
  - Problem: Provenance intensity is mostly numeric and requires close reading across many rows.
  - Hypothesis: Explicit severity chips and consistent row grammar will speed deep-chain vs clean-pick triage.
  - Scope (files):
    - web/app/views/entities/draft_selections/_workspace_main.html.erb
    - web/app/views/entities/draft_selections/_rightpanel_base.html.erb
    - web/app/controllers/entities/draft_selections_controller.rb
    - web/app/controllers/entities/draft_selections_sse_controller.rb
    - web/test/integration/entities_draft_selections_index_test.rb
  - Acceptance criteria:
    - Draft selections workspace renders dense flex rows (no `<table>` in `_workspace_main`).
    - Rows include provenance severity chip taxonomy (e.g., clean / with-trade / deep-chain).
    - Severity taxonomy aligns with lens behavior and sidebar KPI counts.
    - Quick selections panel mirrors row severity grammar.
    - Selection overlay and pivots remain unchanged functionally.
  - Rubric (before → target):
    - Scan speed: 3 → 5
    - Information hierarchy: 4 → 5
    - Interaction predictability: 4 → 5
    - Density/readability: 4 → 4
    - Navigation/pivots: 4 → 5

    - Do not modify Salary Book files.

- [ ] [P2] [TOOL] /tools/team-summary — support next/previous team stepping inside overlay without losing compare context
  - Problem: Users must close overlay or click new rows to compare adjacent teams, breaking drill-in rhythm.
  - Hypothesis: Overlay next/prev controls tied to current filtered ordering will create a faster, predictable triage loop.
  - Scope (files):
    - web/app/views/tools/team_summary/_rightpanel_overlay_team.html.erb
    - web/app/views/tools/team_summary/_workspace_main.html.erb
    - web/app/controllers/tools/team_summary_controller.rb
    - web/app/javascript/tools/team_summary.js
    - web/test/integration/tools_team_summary_test.rb
  - Acceptance criteria:
    - Overlay exposes Next/Prev actions that move through current filtered row order.
    - Stepping updates overlay content and selected row highlight via one SSE flow.
    - Compare slots (A/B) remain intact while stepping.
    - Keyboard escape behavior still closes overlay correctly.
  - Rubric (before → target):
    - Scan speed: 4 → 5
    - Information hierarchy: 4 → 5
    - Interaction predictability: 3 → 5
    - Density/readability: 5 → 5
    - Navigation/pivots: 4 → 5
  - Guardrails:
    - Do not modify Salary Book files.

- [ ] [P3] [INDEX] /agencies — add direct “open in agents lens” pivot from agency rows/overlay
  - Problem: Agency triage often requires immediate jump into agent-level rows, but pivot requires manual nav/filter recreation.
  - Hypothesis: Preserving lens context while pivoting to `/agents` will reduce context-switch friction.
  - Scope (files):
    - web/app/views/entities/agencies/_workspace_main.html.erb
    - web/app/views/entities/agencies/_rightpanel_overlay_agency.html.erb
    - web/app/controllers/entities/agencies_controller.rb
    - web/test/integration/entities_agencies_index_test.rb
  - Acceptance criteria:
    - Agency row and overlay expose one-click pivot to `/agents` pre-scoped to that agency.
    - Pivot preserves year/sort posture where applicable.
    - Returned `/agents` view opens in agents mode with scoped context visible.
    - Existing agency overlay behavior is unaffected.
  - Rubric (before → target):
    - Scan speed: 4 → 5
    - Information hierarchy: 4 → 5
    - Interaction predictability: 4 → 5
    - Density/readability: 4 → 4
    - Navigation/pivots: 4 → 5
  - Guardrails:
    - Do not modify Salary Book files.

- [ ] [P3] [TOOL] /tools/system-values — persist section visibility state in shareable URL
  - Problem: Section visibility toggles are client-only, so shared links reopen with default visibility and lose analyst framing.
  - Hypothesis: Encoding visibility toggles in URL + SSE state will improve collaboration and replayability of analysis views.
  - Scope (files):
    - web/app/views/tools/system_values/show.html.erb
    - web/app/views/tools/system_values/_commandbar.html.erb
    - web/app/controllers/tools/system_values_controller.rb
    - web/test/integration/tools_system_values_test.rb
  - Acceptance criteria:
    - Visibility toggles (System/Tax/Minimum/Rookie) are reflected in URL query state.
    - Reloading or sharing URL restores identical visible-section layout.
    - SSE refresh preserves overlay and visibility state together.
    - Scrollspy and section wayfinding ignore hidden sections correctly.
  - Rubric (before → target):
    - Scan speed: 4 → 4
    - Information hierarchy: 4 → 5
    - Interaction predictability: 3 → 5
    - Density/readability: 4 → 4
    - Navigation/pivots: 4 → 5
  - Guardrails:
    - Do not modify Salary Book files.
