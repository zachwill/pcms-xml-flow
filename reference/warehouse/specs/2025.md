# 2025 (Playground snapshot) — stub

**Source:** `reference/warehouse/2025.json`

The `2025` sheet is a **Playground-style Salary Book** where the base year is effectively fixed to 2025.

- Canonical spec for this UI pattern: [`playground.md`](playground.md)
- Shared formula patterns (roster list, fill-to-12/14, proration, tax): [`patterns.md`](patterns.md)

This sheet exists as a convenience snapshot; it does not introduce new primitives.
