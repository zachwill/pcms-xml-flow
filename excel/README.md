# Sean's Excel Sheets

I took our salary cap analysts old Excel sheets, turned them into JSON, and then made that JSON easier to parse for coding agents.

The idea is we should be able to programmatically build these sheets with code eventually (better versions actually) -- but we need to see the way a salary cap analyst's brain works first.

Each TXT sheet starts off by column and then row.
